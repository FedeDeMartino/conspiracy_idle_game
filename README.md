## How to Play

In **Conspiracy Idle Game**, you start by recruiting followers for the first conspiracy. As you gain followers, you'll unlock more bizarre and outlandish conspiracies. The more conspiracies you unlock, the faster you'll progress!

- **Mouse Click:** Click anywhere on the screen to recruit new followers.
- **B Key:** Buy the next conspiracy when you have enough donations.
- **Escape Key (Esc):** Return to the intro screen.

As your followers grow, auto-generation of followers will begin, allowing you to gather even more followers without clicking.
By buying new conspiracies the modifier for the auto-generation of followers will increase by 1 for every new conspiracy.
