You need to start small...

Lately, you've been noticing some peculiar things.
Subtle, but unsettling. At first, you shrugged it off—but now,
it's all adding up.

Why does everyone keep telling you to eat avocados?
Sure, they say it's 'good for your health,' but hang on...
your parents, and their parents, didn't need avocados,
and they were just fine. So why now, all of a sudden, are they everywhere?

Something's off. It's not just the toast... it's that massive pit.
Could it be? Maybe there’s more to avocados than meets the eye.
What if that pit isn't just a seed... what if it's hiding something?
A chip, perhaps? A secret listening device, tucked inside every avocado,
tracking your every word... every move...

Yes! That must be it! The avocado agenda is real,
and it’s time to blow this wide open!

You have to spread the word before it’s too late!!!
