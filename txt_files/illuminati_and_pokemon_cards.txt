Alright, buckle up,
because this one’s gonna blow your mind…

You know Pokémon cards, right? Those innocent
little collectibles we all traded as kids?
Well, what if I told you the Illuminati is using
them to control the world?

Think about it: those cards spread like wildfire—schools,
playgrounds, everywhere! But it wasn’t just about
catching ‘em all. No, no. The Illuminati embedded hidden
symbols and subliminal messages in every card.
The more you collect, the more you’re programmed.
It’s mind control disguised as a childhood game.
And don’t even get me started on rare cards—those are
the most powerful ones. Charizard? Yeah, that’s basically
the Illuminati’s mascot.

But here’s the kicker: the real power comes when you battle.
The Illuminati has been secretly training us to strategize,
manipulate, and follow orders through these “harmless” card games.
They’ve been conditioning us to follow their agenda without
even realizing it!

And now, as adults? They’re using nostalgia to keep us
hooked—releasing special editions and shiny holographics,
so we keep coming back for more.

So next time someone tells you they “just like the artwork,”
think again. The Illuminati is out there, controlling the world,
one Pokémon card at a time.

Catch that truth before they catch you!
