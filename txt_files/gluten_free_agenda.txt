Alright, let’s talk gluten.

Ten years ago, no one even knew what gluten was.
People were scarfing down bread like it was nothing.
But now? Everyone’s suddenly “gluten-sensitive,”
and gluten is public enemy number one. Suspicious, right?

What if I told you it’s all a ploy? That’s right—Big Gluten-Free is behind it.
They want you to think gluten is evil, so they can sell you overpriced,
cardboard-flavored alternatives. Think about it—gluten-free cookies,
gluten-free pizza, gluten-free water. They’re laughing all the way to the bank!

But here’s the real kicker: gluten isn’t the problem... it’s the propaganda.
They’ve got everyone convinced that a single slice of bread
could bring civilization to its knees. Meanwhile,
they’re cashing in on quinoa and almond flour.

So, next time someone tells you they’re “gluten-intolerant,”
just remember: it’s not their stomach—it’s the system.

Stay woke. Gluten isn’t the issue—the gluten-free agenda is!
