You ever wonder why they push cereal so hard as the perfect breakfast?
Like, everyone says you need to start your day with a bowl of it.
But what if it’s not about nutrition at all?
What if… there’s something hidden in those crunchy little O’s?

Here’s the truth: the government has secretly implanted tiny
tracking chips in breakfast cereal.
That’s right—those “fortified with vitamins” claims? Just a cover.
These chips only last 24 hours in your system,
which is why they make sure you eat cereal every morning.
It’s not about health—it’s about keeping tabs on you.

And that’s why they hate intermittent fasting.
If you skip breakfast, their precious chip expires,
and for a glorious few hours, they lose track of you.
That’s why all the "experts" keep telling you breakfast is the most
important meal of the day—because without your daily dose of cereal,
they’re flying blind!

So the next time you pour yourself a bowl of “whole grain goodness,”
remember: it’s not just cereal—it’s surveillance. Stay vigilant.
Skip a bowl and throw them off the scent!

They can track your steps, but they can’t track your fasting!
