Ever wonder why dogs are so loyal? Always behind you, watching your every move,
wagging their tails like they’re just so happy to see you? Yeah, sure.
It’s cute... but what if it’s something more sinister?

Think about it: dogs are everywhere, in almost every home,
quietly following us,pretending to be our best friends. 
But here’s the kicker—what if they’re actually robots?
Government-issued, high-tech surveillance machines designed to spy on us?
They watch us leave, and they’re thrilled when we come back... 
not because they missed us, but because their data collection is about to continue!

All that barking? Just malfunctioning microphones.
The head tilts? Scanning for info.
And why do they always seem to know when you’re upset? Facial recognition software, obviously.

So next time you scratch your dog behind the ears, remember:
you might just be scratching a government spy!

Keep an eye on your dog... he’s keeping two on you.
