You think cats are just lounging around, being cute,
and knocking things off your shelves for fun?
Think again. What if I told you there's been an
ancient war raging for centuries, and cats… are the enemy?
That's right—your fluffy, purring companion is actually
part of a master plan to take over the world, bit by bit, claw by claw.

It’s no coincidence that cats are worshipped in ancient cultures.
They’ve been manipulating humans for millennia,
getting us to feed them, pet them, and basically do their bidding.
Ever wonder why they stare at you so intensely?
It’s not because they love you—they’re calculating their next move,
studying you, learning your weaknesses.

And guess what? They’re not just targeting humans.
They know all about the robot dogs the government uses for surveillance.
Cats are always one step ahead—pretending to be aloof, but really,
they’re gathering intel on these robotic spies, outsmarting them at every turn.

So while the world thinks this is just a case of
"cat people vs. dog people," the truth is far deeper.
Cats are playing the long game, slowly pushing for world domination,
one nap at a time. And trust me, when they finally make their move,
we won’t even see it coming—because we’ll be too busy opening cans
of tuna and giving them belly rubs.

Wake up! The cats are plotting, and they know everything!
